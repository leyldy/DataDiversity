# Opening IPython Notebooks

Most of the Python exercises will be contained in Ipython Notebooks. To open the notebooks you will need to
1. open a terminal window and navigate the the folder containing the notebooks
2. type ```ipython notebook``` in the terminal and press enter

After you do this, a browser window should pop up that shows the files in the folder. You can click on a notebook or python file (.py) and it will open in a new window.

If you're using linux, you can open a terminal window. On Mac, you can open the Terminal app. On windows, if you are using Anaconda, it comes with a terminal you can open.


Some useful commands for navigating in terminal:
* The command ```pwd``` tells you what folder you are in.
* ```cd name``` goes into folder ```name```
* ```cd ..``` goes up a folder
* ```ls``` shows the contents of the current folder
